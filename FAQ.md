[ [ACCUEIL](README.md) ]

#### [1. Which version of Dofus ?](#nr1) ####

> 1.29 and RETRO in 32bit

#### [2. What operating system does DofusPouletFlemmards need?](#nr1) ####

> Windows only, doesn't work Mac OS since AHK doesn't exist on Mac


#### [3. My computer struggle to run X Dofus, can I run DofusPouletFlemmards without problems ?](#nr1) ####

> Not recommended, some functions will behave inconsistently.
> For example, if you have 8 characters and you use Auto Move, only 7 will move then 8 then 6...

> Auto Move/Ready/Join/Escape will be frustrating to use, you will have to go back to the char that didn't move or didn't get ready etc. by
spamming the key to switch between tabs just to find back that damn character

> You could slow the function by adjusting the delay, but beyond a certain time (1000ms)... might as well do it manually !
> You can still use auto Switch without any problem, you can leave it ON during your gaming session if you don't have any issues otherwise
just disable it at the end of each combat 
> DofusPouletFlemmards runs at  Ã  0% of the CPU and between 0 and 5% when Auto Switch is enabled
>(The slower the delay of Auto Switch is, the higher the CPU usage is)

#### [4. Where are the accounts stored ?](#nr1) ####

> When you first start the program, a folder named DofusPourLesFlemmards will be created in your Documents
> DofusPouletFlemmards folder contains :
> *  **accounts.txt** file to store your accounts
> *  **settings.ini** file  to store your configurations ( shortcut, delays)
> * A folder **screenshot* to store your screenshot containing the name of your character (Auto Switch)
