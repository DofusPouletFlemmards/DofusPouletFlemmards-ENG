## SHORTCUTS <a name="raccourcis"></a>

You can change default shortcuts on DofusPouletFlemmards.
It's not possible to add the functions of a mouse (Click,wheel) as a hotkey from the interface, you have to edit the settings.ini file

- Open **DofusPouletFlemmards**,  [**AUTO**] tab
- **EDIT FILE**
- Look for the function that you want to change in [AUTO] and assign the key you want to use
- Then restart the program ( by default : Alt + & or exit and restart)

**Example**

| CTRL + Left CLICK               	| ALT + Left CLICK             	| WheelUp      	|
|------------------------------------	|------------------------------------	|---------------------	|
| AutoMoveKey=^LButton               	| AutoMoveKey=!LButton               	| AutoMoveKey=WheelUp 	|
| ^ : CTRL                           	| ! : ALT                            	|                     	|


On DofusPouletFlemmards'interface, the hotkey will appear as " Ctrl + " but don't worry, it has correctly been changed

**Exemple 2 - Switch Tab**<a name="tab"></a>

| TAB                	| 
|------------------------------------	|
| SwitchTabKey=TAB               	|


For more information about hotkeys see :
https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm
https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm#mouse-general

> /!\ I do not recommend using CTRL + Click as a shortcut, on Dofus Ctrl+Click allows you to move a stack of item.
You can use CTRL + Click if and only if you're planning to use auto CtrlClicker which is what I do personally (by default : Alt+C)
Or you could set it as CTRL+M for example and set it on your mouse buttons


## Auto Log In<a name="autologin"></a>

> /!\ If you don't use Auto Log In and start dofus from Ankama Launcher
> make sure that Dofus is set up on 32bit


If you have changed the default installation folder
- When you press Start, It'll ask you to open the Dofus.exe file that is located in your installation folder :
>...\Ankama\zaap\retro\resources\app.asar.unpacked\retroclient

**How to add an account ?**
- Put your ID and password and press ADD
- If you have the same password for each account, you can directly edit the file by clicking on "Edit file" button


Your file must be of this format :

>id:pw  
>id:pw  
>id:pw  

_**(OPTIONAL)**_ To make things easier, check "Keep GUI on top" it'll keep DofusPouletFlemmard on top of every windows
